# PracticeFreeRTOS

Welcome to the PracticeFreeRTOS repository!

## Project Overview

This repository contains a series of projects designed to help you practice and master FreeRTOS. Each project demonstrates different aspects of FreeRTOS, from basic task scheduling to more complex real-time applications. These projects are aimed at providing hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of FreeRTOS in embedded systems.

## Project List

- **Real-Time Task Scheduling Simulation**: Simulate and observe task scheduling with different priorities.
- **Simple IoT Sensor System**: Simulate an IoT sensor node with tasks for data collection, processing, and transmission.
- **Real-Time Data Logger**: Capture and store data from simulated sensors using task management.
- **Task Communication via Queues**: Implement a producer-consumer scenario with tasks exchanging data through queues.
- **Real-Time Event Handling System**: Handle real-time events using FreeRTOS event flags.
- **Simple Real-Time Game Engine**: Develop a basic game engine with tasks for game logic, rendering, and input handling.
- **Real-Time Alarm System**: Manage alarms based on triggers with task management.
- **Real-Time Web Server Simulation**: Simulate a web server handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Embedded Device Management System**: Manage an embedded device with tasks for configuration, monitoring, and control.
- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Implement tasks for audio capture, processing, and playback.
- **Simple Robotics Control System**: Control a robotic system with tasks for motor control, sensor reading, and navigation.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Visualize real-time data with tasks for collection, processing, and display.
- **Multi-Tasking File System**: Simulate a file system with concurrent file operations.
- **Real-Time Communication Protocol Implementation**: Handle a communication protocol with tasks for data processing.
- **Embedded System with Task Scheduling and Synchronization**: Demonstrate advanced task scheduling and synchronization features.
